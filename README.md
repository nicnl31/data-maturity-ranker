# Data Maturity Ranker Algorithm

This is a university project whose primary purpose is to develop a preliminary NLP-based assessment to analyse different companies on how data-mature they are, using a proprietary Data Maturity Model (DMM). This project will not give the company a metric on how data mature it is, because the metric derived
for a single company is not meant to be used only for the company. Instead, it will push towards
comparing to other companies and how to gain a lead in comparison to the other companies
analysed.

This toy algorithm will be applied towards 5 major ASX companies with different sectors to compare and contrast their approach. They are:
- CSL Limited (CSL),
- Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA),
- BHP Group (BHP),
- Woolworths Group (WOW), and
- Telstra Corporation (TLS).

# Project Methodology
Since the project offers a fresh perspective on companiesâ€™ data maturity that has not been
established elsewhere, the challenges are to:
- Create a Data Maturity Model (DMM) that most effectively captures the current state of data
maturity in a company, while only using publicly available information.
- Create a scoring model and benchmark, based on the proposed DMM. The goal is not to
assess a single company based on a score, but rather to compare different companies based
on the relative range of scores.
- Create different datasets by means of scraping and modelling, to arrive at scoring results that
can be easily interpreted.
